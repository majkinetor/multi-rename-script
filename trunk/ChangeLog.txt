v1.2
-----
+ Unicode support. Total Commander plugins are still not unicode (because mostly still don't support it). AHK plugins are Unicode.
+ Resizable window (window placement is saved in ini)
+ Rename operation will create directory if it doesn't exist (thx __meta__)
* Preset Save button and DropDown replaced with single editable ComboBox.
  To save preset write its desired name and press ENTER.
  To load preset select it from the list or type its name.


Bugs:
- IniWrite in GuiExit() doesn't work with Unicode.
- ShellExtension stopped working.
