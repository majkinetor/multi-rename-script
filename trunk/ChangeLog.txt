v1.5
----------------
+ You don't have to add AutoHotKey to DEP list any more (Lexikos).
+ AHK_L updated to 1.0.92.02 - January 19, 2011. This allows MRS script to keep its original name (MRS.ahk instead AutoHotKey.ini). 
  You can delete MRS.exe if you already have AHK_L asociated with ahk files.
+ Plugin updates: Shell Details 1.22

v1.5c 19/02/2010
----------------
! Fixed issue with content plugins that have - in the name (i.e. jpg-comment.wdx)
+ Optimization: Improved speed of editor preview a lot.

v1.5b 09/02/2010
----------------
+ TCWdx module improved: 
  + Unicode support for TC content plugins - module will first try W export, then A export, then it will return error.
  + It cashes function adresses for faster subsequent calls. HTML manual for external use.
  * Removed dependency on folder names to be equal to content plugins names. When TC ini file is not present, module now searches recursively for all wdx files in the \plugins folder.
* Range will no longer flicker in "select range" inputbox. Inputbox is wider.
+ Added TC content plugin cputil.wdx which allows to find file names with characters from a different code page, and rename them using conversion table.
+ ShellDetails.wdx updated to Unicode version.

v1.5a 08/02/2010
----------------
+ Unicode support in GUI and AHK Plugins. Total Commander plugins are still not unicode (because they still mostly don't support it).
+ Resizable window (window placement is saved in ini)
+ Rename operation will create directory if it doesn't exist (__meta__)
+ If you hold CTRL while using drag&drop or shell extension to add single folder, MRS will add its files instead.
* Preset Save button and DropDown replaced with single editable ComboBox.
  To save preset write its desired name and press ENTER.
  To load preset select it from the list or type its name.
