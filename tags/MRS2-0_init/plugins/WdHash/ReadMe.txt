  wdHash is a simple content-plugin for the Total Commander (http://ghisler.com) that intended for calculation of checksums (hashes) for any file. Checksums can be used to control correctness of a file transfer on the network, for example, and wdHash allows to output them in tooltips above the files in the file panel or in custom columns. Besides, the checksums calculated by wdHash can be used at Multi-Rename-Tool and for filesearch.
  wdHash can initially calculate checksums using the CRC32, MD5 and SHA1 algorithms. But one of the key feature of this plugin is that amount of supported algorithms  can be easily increased by adding extra second-level plugins. One can download a number of additional second level plugins from the homepage of the wdHash (http://slsoft.narod.ru/wdhash.html). There are plugins that add support of various modifications of the such algorithms as Haval, RipeMD, SHA, MD, Tiger, etc.
  The second feature of the wdHash is its ability to work in a background. This makes its usage more convenient and allows to reduce delays when waiting for calculation of hashe in such situations as calculation of long checksums for the files having the big size.

  All comments about the plugin and suggestions on improvement of its functionality can be sended to me via e-mail (slsoft@yandex.ru). Additional contact information can be found on the following page: http://slsoft.narod.ru/contacts.html.
